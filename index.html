    <h1>SMITHENATOR5000</h1><hr/>
	<h2>Who am I?</h2>
	I am a theoretical physics student in the UK and an amateur programmer. Nothing much more to say, to be perfectly honest.<hr/>
	<h2>What Do I Do?</h2>
	I won't tell you everything but what I will say, is that I am currently working on a very basic, but intuitive C++ linear algebra library. I'm calling it <strong>smithlin</strong> (I'm so creative) but don't be fooled into thinking I'm serious about this. It's just a bit of honest fun to pass the time. <hr/>
	<h2>Links to Current Work</h2>
	<a href="./smithlin/"><strong>smithlin</strong></a>- A basic but intuitive linear algebra library for C++. Very early in development. <hr/>
	<h2>Future Projects?</h2>
	I've nothing particular in mind but I am quite keen on making physics-based and maths-based things. Perhaps I'll make something educational but who knows at this point?
